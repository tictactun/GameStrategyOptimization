    "## <center>1. Introduction</center> ##\n",
    "In team sports, strategy plays a vital role in determining which team emerges victorious since team clashes cannot always be won by relying on individual prowess alone. The importance of strategy gains even more significance when the sport involves a series of head-to-head individual games between team members like in the [Davis Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup), [Fed Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup) or the [Chess Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Olympiad) where a good match-up strategy (who plays whom) can lead to results that defy expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to solve the problem of determining the best match-up strategy that a team should adopt to maximize chances of winning in a sequence of individual games. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.A. History and Background ###\n",
    "Historically, there have been several instances where team rubbers have been won purely on the basis of a match-up strategy (who plays whom), despite being at a disadvantage in terms of individual ability or expertise.\n",
    "<p>At the Chess Olympiad in 2014, the Indian contingent, despite being seeded $19^{th}$, managed to win the bronze medal in the tournament. According to experts, strategic planning was key to India's success, apart from great performances by the members of the team ([citation article](https://www.sportskeeda.com/chess/solid-play-strategic-planning-key-to-indias-success-at-chess-olympiad)). The Indian team had decided to adopt their success strategy of the Asian Nations Cup, fielding the strongest players at the lower boards and a mix of highly rated and lower-rated but solid players at the top two boards.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> The aforementioned example, along with other \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.B. Jargon ###\n",
    "Here, we define a set of technical terms that form the foundation of the concepts discussed in the report.\n",
    "<p><b>Rubber:</b> A rubber is a team contest consisting of a sequence of successive games that is won by the side that wins a majority of the individual games.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Strategy:</b> In game theory, a player's strategy is any of the options he or she can choose in a setting where the outcome depends not only on his own actions but on the action of others. A player's strategy will determine the action the player will take at any stage of the game. In the case of a team contest(rubber), we define a strategy as the assignment of each team member to a member of the opposition.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Pure Strategy:</b> A pure strategy is an unconditional, defined choice that a person makes in a situation or game. For example, in the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors,if a player would choose to only play scissors for each and every independent trial, regardless of the other player’s strategy, choosing scissors would be the player’s pure strategy. The probability for choosing scissors equal to 1 and all other options (paper and rock) is chosen with the probability of 0. The set of all options (i.e. rock, paper, and scissors) available in this game is known as the strategy set.\n",
    "In the case of a team contest like the Chess Olympiad, an example of a team's pure strategy would be to always assign players as illustrated in the following figure:\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "![mixed strategy][cb_1] \n",
    "![mixed strategy][cb_2] \n",
    "![mixed strategy][cb_3] \n",
    "![mixed strategy][cb_4] \n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Mixed Strategy:</b> A mixed strategy is an assignment of a probability to each pure strategy. A mixed strategy is an assignment of probability to all choices in the strategy set. Using the example of Rock-Paper-Scissors, if a person’s probability of employing each pure strategy is equal, then the probability distribution of the strategy set would be 1/3 for each option, or approximately 33%. In other words, a person using a mixed strategy incorporates more than one pure strategy into a game. This allows for a player to randomly select a pure strategy. Since probabilities are continuous, there are infinitely many mixed strategies available to a player. A mixed strategy can simply be considered as the probability distribution one uses to randomly choose among available actions in order to avoid being predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, one can regard a pure strategy as a degenerate case of a mixed strategy, in which that particular pure strategy is selected with probability 1 and every other strategy with probability 0.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "![mixed strategy][cb_1] \n",
    "![mixed strategy][cb_2] \n",
    "![mixed strategy][cb_3] \n",
    "![mixed strategy][cb_4] \n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<b>Nash Equilibrium:</b>\n",
    "In game theory, the Nash equilibrium is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his or her own strategy.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.C. Outline###\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Our project attempts to use a combination of optimization and the aforementioned game theoretic concepts for determining the optimal match-up strategy for a team to maximize its probability of winning a rubber under a set of conditions that simulate a real world scenario. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "We go about this task by building a series of optimization models each more comprehensive than the previous one. We start with the simple case of designing a winning pure strategy when the opposition's strategy is known. We then remove the assumption of knowledge of opposition's strategy in the second model and replace it with the assumption of that the opposition team determines its strategy rationally. In the subsequent model, we relax the restriction to pure strategies. In this third model, we try to find the optimal mixed strategy from the perspective of both teams to determine if a Nash equilibrium exists. Finally, we add the complexity of determining a team's composition (from a set of available players) in addition to a team's strategy while having a budget trade-off in place.  \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Although we limit the discussion to clashes between Chess teams for the purpose of this project, the task at hand is extremely interesting because it is equally applicable to several other team sports such as tennis and boxing. The only prerequisite is the existence of an empirical or actual mathematical model to determine chances of winning individual matches or rounds for that sport. \n",
    "Moreover, the models developed within the project can also be used to develop strategies for online battle strategy games like Age of Empires and Clash of Clans as well as for determining squad composition and battle order in card and video games like Pokemon. \n",

    "<p> In this project, we have illustrated how optimization techniques can be leveraged to determine the best strategy for a team to use in order to maximize winning chances in chess clashes. We also illustrated how to determine the best chess team composition to maximize probability of winning under budget constraints.</p>\n",
    "<p> The optimization models built as part of this project project can be applied, without modification, to determine optimal strategies for any team sports with rubbers that are non-cooperative in nature. The Davis cup and the Fed Cup are examples of tournaments in the realm of tennis where these models can potentially prove to be extremely effective for maximizing winning probabilities.</p>\n",
    "The models built in this project, however, are not applicable to all team sports. Since they do not account for the element of cooperation between team members, they would require modification in order to determine strategies for team sports like soccer and basketball. An interesting future direction for this project would be to extend the models to include cooperative team sports as well.    \n",
