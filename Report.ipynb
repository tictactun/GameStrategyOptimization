    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "In team sports, strategy plays a vital role in determining which team emerges victorious since team clashes cannot always be won by relying on individual prowess alone. The importance of strategy gains even more significance when the sport involves a series of head-to-head individual games between team members like in the [Davis Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup), [Fed Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup) or the [Chess Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Olympiad) where a good match-up strategy (who plays whom) can lead to results that defy expectations. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "This project aims to solve the problem of determining the best match-up strategy that a team should adopt to maximize chances of winning in a sequence of individual games. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.A. History and Significance ###\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "Historically, there have been several instances, where a team rubber has been won purely on the basis of a match-up strategy (who plays whom), despite being at a disadvantage in terms of individual ability or expertise.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "The origin of the problem lies in the legendary [Chinese horse race story](http://chinese-story-collection.blogspot.com/2010/10/tian-jis-horse-race-tian-ji-sai-ma.html) involving the King of Qi and General Tianji which\n",
    "took place more than 2000 years ago. In this problem each player owned three horses of different speed classes\n",
    "and had to choose the sequence of horses to compete against each other. Tianji beat the King of Qi despite having horses that were slower than the King's horses of the corresponding speed category. He did so by racing his fastest horse against the King's moderate-paced, his moderate-paced against the King's slowest and his slowest against the King's fastest. Although he lost the last match by a large margin, he won the other two rounds, thereby winning overall.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\"> \n",
    "More recently, at the Chess Olympiad in 2014, the Indian contingent, despite being seeded $19^{th}$, managed to win the bronze medal in the tournament. According to experts, strategic planning was key to India's success, apart from great performances by the members of the team ([citation article](https://www.sportskeeda.com/chess/solid-play-strategic-planning-key-to-indias-success-at-chess-olympiad)). The Indian team had decided to adopt a success strategy of fielding the strongest players at the lower boards and a mix of highly rated and lower-rated but solid players at the top two boards.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\"> \n",
    "The aforementioned event perfectly exemlifies the importance of match-up strategy in team sports involving a series of individual games. It should be noted that solving the problem of determining a team's best one-on-one strategy is not restricted to the realm of chess and is a much more universal challenge. In fact, the task at hand becomes infinitely more engaging and interesting when one thinks about its numerous applications. The techniques described in this project are applicable, without any modification, to other team sports such as tennis, wrestling and boxing, that involve a series of one-on-one games to determine the victorious team. The only prerequisite is the existence of an empirical or theoretical mathematical model to determine realtive chances of winning or expected score obtained in individual matches. \n",
    "Moreover, the models developed within the project can also be used to develop strategies for online battle strategy games like Age of Empires and Clash of Clans as well as for determining squad composition and battle order in card and video games like Pokemon. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "Now that we have obtained a bird's eye view of the problem, its origin and potential applications of a solution, in the subsequent subsections, we provide an overview of the specifics of the problem (jargon) as well as our approach to finding a solution (outline).   \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.B. Terminology ###\n",
    "Here, we define a set of technical terms that form the foundation of the concepts discussed in this report.\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\"><b>Rubber:</b> A rubber is a team contest consisting of a sequence of successive games that is won by the side that wins a majority of the individual games. Famous examples of events that involve rubbers are the [Davis Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup), the [Fed Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup) in tennis and the [Chess Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Olympiad), the [World Team Chess Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Team_Chess_Championship) in chess.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "<b>Strategy:</b> In game theory, a player's strategy is any of the options he or she can choose in a setting where the outcome depends not only on his own actions but on the action of others. In the case of a team contest(rubber), we define a strategy as the assignment of each team member to a member of the opposition. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "<b>Pure Strategy:</b> A [pure strategy](http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/PureStrategy.html) is an unconditional, defined choice that a player makes in a game. For example, ALWAYS (100% of the time) assigning players 1, 2, 3, 4 to play against opposition's D, A, B, C respectively is a pure strategy.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "<b>Mixed Strategy:</b> A [mixed strategy](http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/MixedStrategy.html) is an assignment of a probability to each pure strategy. \n",
    "For example, assigning team players 1, 2, 3, 4 to play against opposition's D, A, B, C respectively for 50% of the time and against opposition's C, A, D, B respectively for the remaining 50% of the time is an example of a mixed strategy. A mixed strategy can simply be considered as the probability distribution one uses to randomly choose among available actions in order to avoid being predictable.\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "Of course, one can regard a pure strategy as a degenerate case of a mixed strategy, in which that particular pure strategy is selected with probability 1 and every other strategy with probability 0.\n",
    "</p> \n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "<b>Nash Equilibrium:</b>\n",
    "[Nash Equilibrium](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nash-equilibrium.asp#ixzz4gSfkX0Wn) is a pair of strategies in which each player’s strategy is the best response to the other player’s strategy and no player has an incentive to deviate from his chosen strategy after considering an opponent's choice. Overall, in a Nash Equilibrium, a team can receive no incremental benefit (only stands to lose) from changing actions, assuming other team remains constant in its strategy. \n",
    "For example, let us assume one team adopts a strategy of ordering players as 1, 2, 3, 4 and let the other team adopt a strategy of B, A, C, D without knowledge of each others' strategies. Now, the the first team's strategy is revealed to the second team and vice versa. If neither team decides to switch their strategy with this new information, then the strategy pair ({1234}, {BACD}) is said to form a Nash Equilibrium.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "A more detailed explanation of the aforementioned concepts with respect to the popular Rock-Paper-Scissor game can be found in the [Appendix](#Game-Theory-Jargon:-Rock-Paper-Scissor).\n",
    "Having understood the game theoretic concepts involved in solving the problem of strategy determination, the next subsection describes the outline of our report particularly the incremental approach of starting from a naive model and building a more generalizd solution.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.C. Outline###\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "Our project attempts to use a combination of optimization and the aforementioned game theoretic concepts for determining the optimal match-up strategy for a team to maximize its probability of winning a rubber under a set of conditions that simulate a real world scenario. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "We go about this task by building a series of optimization models each more comprehensive than the previous one. We start with the simple case of designing a winning pure strategy for the home team when the opposition's strategy is known. We then eliminate the assumption of knowledge of opposition's strategy in the second model and replace it with the assumption that the opposition will always respond by adopting a strategy to minimize the home team's chances of winning. We also try to check if a pure Nash Equilibrium exists in this case. In the subsequent model, we remove the constraint of being restricted to pure strategies. In this model, we try to find the optimal mixed strategy from the perspective of both teams to determine if a mixed Nash equilibrium exists. Finally, we add the complexity of determining a team's composition (from a set of available players) in addition to a team's strategy while having a budget trade-off in place.  \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "We illustrate the aforementioned scenarios (starting from section 3) by using a case study approach with chess teams being the focus. The next section provides details and building blocks of the chess ecosystem that are necessary for the subsequent optimization modelling tasks. \n",

    "<li>In tournaments like the [Chess Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Olympiad)) and the [World Team Chess Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Team_Chess_Championship), among others, each team clash (rubber) consists of 4 individual games.\n",
    "<li>In a tournament match, colors are assigned to the teams for the first board. After that, the colors switch on alternating boards. For instance, if a team's first board plays White, the second board will play Black, and the third board will play White. All of a team's odd numbered boards will play one color, while all of the same team's even numbered boards will play the other color. This is done in order to eliminate the [first-move advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-move_advantage_in_chess) described in the next section.    \n",
    "<li>At the end of each game, the winning team gets 1 point. The losing side earns no points and a draw results in both teams being allotted 0.5 points. \n",

    "<ul style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "<li> We modeled the winning probability of a player based on the [ELO rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) of the player and his opponent. The model used was based on a [study](https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Pawn+Advantage%2C+Win+Percentage%2C+and+ELO) by Sune Fischer and Pradu Kannan in Dec. 2007. Details of the model can be found here: [Elo-Rating & Win-Probability](https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Match+Statistics).\n",

    "Expected score: $Expected Score_{player 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-\\frac{\\Delta}{400}}}$   where $\\Delta = Elo_{player 1} - Elo_{player 2}$\n",
    "<li> It is important to note that the winning probability is also the expected score from a given game. This is because there is no effect of weights since points scored are betwen 0 and 1. This is why the expected score from a match between teams is simply the sum of expected scores (interchangeably probabilities of winning) from each individual game of the match.\n",
    "<li> Another important distinction to remember is that the expected scores reported in this report are always with respect to the home team. Even while modelling from the opponent's perspective, the score reported is the home team's score. This is because we assume that the home team tries to maximize its expected score and the opposition tries to lower it.\n",
    "<li> The [first-move advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-move_advantage_in_chess) in chess is the inherent advantage of the player (White) who makes the first move in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. We have modeled this advantage by adding 35 to the Black side's player's ELO. [citation required]()\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "First-move advantage: $Elo_{white} = Elo_{black} + 35 $  \n",
    "<li> To make things more interesting, we decided to add the complexity of making each round (individual game) distinct by adding weights to the maximum points that can be earned from each of the rounds. The maximum points reduce linearly (by a small fraction) as one moves from the first round to the fourth round. Doing this not only makes the rounds distinguishable, but also helps factor in the perception of the initial rounds having more significance. \n",
    "Weighted rounds: $Weight_{round\\_k}: 1 + \\frac{1}{100}(1 - \\frac{k}{N})$ where $N$ is the number of players under consideration (usually team size).\n",

    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\"> In this project, we have illustrated how optimization techniques can be leveraged to determine the best strategy for a team in order to maximize winning chances based on game theoretic concepts. We also illustrated how to determine the best chess team composition and strategy to maximize probability of winning under budget constraints.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">Through the course of the project, we used practical results of optimization models to introduce and exemplify theoretical game theory concepts. Specifically, we applied optimization concepts seen in class such as primal modeling, dual transformation, trade-off and strong duality to illustrate game theoretic concepts like Nash Equilibrium as well as Maximin and Minimax strategies.</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\"> We provided both empirical and theoretical evidence that, in general, the Maximin optimal <= Minimax optimal. A Nash equilibrium would exist when the equality holds (Maximin = Minimax). We also proved, both mathematically as well as in practice, how the Nash Equilibrium (if one exists) can be found by solving the primal and dual forms of a game. If the optimal values of primal and dual forms are equal to each other (strong duality holds) then that is a Nash Equilibrium of the game.</p> \n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\"> The optimization models built as part of this project project can be applied, without modification, to determine optimal strategies for any team sports with rubbers that are non-cooperative in nature.\n",
    "The techniques described in this project are applicable, without any modification, to other team sports such as tennis, wrestling and boxing, that involve a series of one-on-one games to determine the victorious team.  The [Davis Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup) and the [Fed Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup) are examples of tournaments in the realm of tennis where these models can potentially prove to be extremely effective for maximizing winning probabilities. \n",
    "The models presented can also be modified slightly to develop strategies for online battle strategy games like Age of Empires and Clash of Clans as well as for determining squad composition and battle order in card and video games like Pokemon. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "The models built in this project, however, are not trivially extendable to all team sports. Since they do not account for the element of cooperation between team members, they would require major modification in order to determine strategies for team sports like soccer and basketball. An interesting direction for further extension of this project would be to extend the idea to include cooperative team sports as well. This would require us to possess a mathematical model that accurately takes into account each team member's contribution to the strength of other tem members' strength while estimating relative probability of winning against an opposition. </p>"

    "### Game Theory Jargon: Rock-Paper-Scissor ###\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "<b>Pure Strategy:</b> A pure strategy is an unconditional, defined choice that a person makes in a situation or game. For example, in the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors,if a player would choose to only play scissors for each and every independent trial, regardless of the other player’s strategy, choosing scissors would be the player’s pure strategy. The set of all options (i.e. rock, paper, and scissors) available in this game is known as the strategy set.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "<b>Mixed Strategy:</b> A mixed strategy is an assignment of a probability to each pure strategy in the strategy set. Using the example of Rock-Paper-Scissors, if a person’s probability of employing each pure strategy is equal, then the probability distribution of the strategy set would be 1/3 for each option, or approximately 33%. In other words, a person using a mixed strategy incorporates more than one pure strategy into a game. This allows for a player to randomly select a pure strategy. Since probabilities are continuous, there are infinitely many mixed strategies available to a player. A mixed strategy can simply be considered as the probability distribution one uses to randomly choose among available actions in order to avoid being predictable.\n",
    "Of course, one can regard a pure strategy as a degenerate case of a mixed strategy, in which that particular pure strategy is selected with probability 1 and every other strategy with probability 0. If a pure strategy in Rock-Paper-Scissors is to play scissors, thenit can be considered a mixed strategy where probability for choosing scissors equal to 1 and all other options (paper and rock) are chosen with the probability of 0.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "<b>Nash Equilibrium:</b>\n",
    "[Nash Equilibrium](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nash-equilibrium.asp#ixzz4gSfkX0Wn) is a pair of strategies in which each player’s strategy is the best response to the other player’s strategy and no player has an incentive to deviate from his chosen strategy after considering an opponent's choice. Overall, in a Nash Equilibrium, an individual can receive no incremental benefit (only stands to lose) from changing actions, assuming other player remains constant in his strategy.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that games can have\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only one pure Nash Equilibrium \n",
    "- Only one mixed Nash Equilibrium and no pure Nash Equilibrium \n",
    "- Multiple pure Nash Equilibrium \n",
    "- Pure and mixed Nash Equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = \"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "It can be seen that Rock-Paper-Scissors belongs to the second category.The reason why there isn’t a pure Nash Equilibrium is that there is no way a player can hope to win if he makes the same choice 100% of the time. For example, let’s take player 1. If he consistently plays rock, then player 2 will always choose paper. Player 1 will never win. Thus, there is no pure equilibrium – it just doesn’t make sense for one player to ALWAYS pick one choice for the whole game – it’s just too predictable. There is, however, a mixed Nash Equilibrium wherein each player plays each of rock, paper and scissors approximately 33% of the time. Even knowing that player 1 is adopting this mixed strategy of (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) does not give player 2 any reason to change his strategy of (1/3, 1/3, 1/3). If player 1 plays any other strategy, say (1/4, 1/4, 1/2), player 2 can exploit that information and win. Therefore, (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) is the mixed Nash Equilibrium for Rock-Paper-Scissors. \n",
